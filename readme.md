# OnePageApp Template

A comprehensive one-page HTML template that demonstrates modern web development capabilities with minimal setup complexity.

## Overview

Sometimes it's nice to go back to the basics and just build a web application in one file. This template provides a complete development environment without the overhead of build tools, transpilation, or complex project structures.

All that fancy build tooling is gone - no webpack, no types, no minification. Just load the page and go.

If the whole project can be expressed in one file, it is entirely self-contained and will not deprecate over time. It can be deployed locally, and through a web-server.

It's just plain JavaScript so you can view the source in your browser directly!

## Features

### Included Libraries (All CDN-based)
- **Vue 3** - Modern reactive framework that works without transpilation
- **Bootstrap 5** - Responsive CSS framework with beautiful default styles
- **Font Awesome** - Comprehensive icon library
- **Pug** - Clean, expressive templating engine for building DOM structures
- **Lodash** - Essential utility functions for JavaScript
- **Plotly.js** - Interactive charting and visualization library
- **Ky** - Modern HTTP client for API requests

### Current Demonstrations

## Philosophy
